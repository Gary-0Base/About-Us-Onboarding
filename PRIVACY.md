## Are Your Data Policies The Same In All Countries?

## How Is My Data Anonymized?

## How And Where Does Zerobase Store My Data?

All personally-identifying data lives solely on a user's mobile device and is never transmitted to Zerobase. Zerobase stores only an anonymous ID associated with a user's device, and without explicit action from the user, Zerobase can never derive which device corresponds to a particular ID. Hence, we never store any personally-identifying information whatsoever without explicit permission. We're the good guys, we promise :)
