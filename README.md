## What is Zerobase?
Zerobase is a smart tracing technology that helps public health officials identify individuals in our communities who have interacted with someone with COVID-19. In light of scarce testing resources, tracing supercharges each available test kit by helping identify the hundreds of untested members of a community that are at risk of infection based on their proximity to an infected individual. You can find more info in the [attached PDF](Zerobase-Basic.pdf).

At its core Zerobase is a location tracker for community hot spots. Businesses, organizations, locations use a designated smartphone to enroll, print out a QR code, and request that every individual entering the premise scan the code. We work with public health agencies to then backtrace potential exposure events in the case that an individual tests positive and notify all affected locations and individuals with next steps.

We offer unparalleled privacy for users by utilizing innovative and powerful cryptography, so you can trust that the sensitive
data relating to an individual's CoV-SARS-2 testing cannot be tampered with and is kept anonymized. Additionally, we're 100% 
open-source, so anyone can audit our code for security and/or privacy concerns at any time. 

If you're looking for a further explanation of who we are and what we're doing, check out our [one-page mission statement and
organizational summary](./Zerobase-Basic.pdf).

## How Do I Use Zerobase?
Zerobase is designed to be as easy as possible for new users to integrate into their routines, and requires very little training and
almost zero technical know-how. The user needs only to do three things:

1. Register themselves with Zerobase simply by visiting [our website](https://zerobase.io) on a mobile device
2. Scan Zerobase QR codes whenever they encounter them (takes under two seconds!)
3. Occassionally, check back at [our website](https://zerobase.io) for any new notifications. Additionally, users can subscribe to one
of our direct messaging systems (SMS, email, push notifications)

That's it! Zerobase is fast and easy to use by design. With practice, pulling out your phone and scanning a QR code can be done in under
two seconds, requiring very minimal disruption to the user's day.

## How Is Zerobase Implemented?
If you're curious how Zerobase works and want to learn more, see [our privacy statement](./PRIVACY.md) for the specifics of how we 
provide this service with an unrivaled promise of privacy. Additionally, we're 100% open-source, so if you want to see how
something works or how your data is handled, you can view our source code directly. The only thing you *can't* see is our private user
data.
