Q&A about Zerobase for Local Governments and Community Officials

Bottom line: Why should governments and communities use Zerobase? 
Zerobase enables local communities to establish a first line of defense against outbreaks in a way that’s private, easy to use, and helps mitigate the manual issues involved in contact tracing and individualized testing triage.
Testing and tracing will effectively contain a pandemic. If a community has sufficient testing resources, the burden on tracing is reduced. However, if a community does not have sufficient testing resources, manual contact tracing becomes extremely difficult. Zerobase automates and distributes contact tracing across a community in a way that's easy and private to deploy and use. Virtual contact tracing allows public health officials to allocate their time and resources more efficiently, elevating a community’s ability to contain the virus.
When a person tests positive for novel coronavirus the race begins. Locating everyone the patient interacted with, and those that interacted with them. Zerobase enables public health agencies a way to recreate those interactions in a way that’s private and instant.
What is Zerobase?
Zerobase is a tool used by state and local health officials to pinpoint individuals who are the most likely to next contract COVID-19. Zerobase uses anonymized predictive technology to help protect communities before an outbreak occurs, which enables officials to best allocate their resources, eliminates guesswork, and reduces illness and fear.

How much does it cost?
Zerobase is being offered without charge. It has been organized as a nonprofit effort and labor has been donated.

Who is building Zerobase? 
Zerobase was created by a team of volunteer technologists and medical professionals concerned about the spread of coronavirus among their fellow communities. Using local data, their program traces the likely path of travel of the virus, identifying the next prospective patients before illness can spread further.  

How does it work?
Local governments work with businesses, places of worship, and other gathering spaces in their communities to post a QR code at the entrance or another obvious highly trafficked spot. Individuals visiting those locations scan the QR code on their way in and their information is then anonymized and analyzed to ascertain likely patterns of spread in that community. The data builds up invisible networks of interaction among people. If someone tests positive, the program can inform local health authorities of the next likely people to contract and spread illness. Patients and prospective patients are informed anonymously via their cell phones. The more data that is collected and aggregated, the more accurate its predictive properties. Over time, communities deploying Zerobase help sister communities to be even better prepared for viral spread.
What are the main advantages of using Zerobase in a community?
Privacy First. We provide effective monitoring solutions for local governments and communities without compromising individual privacy or reducing trust.
Easy to Use. Anyone with a smartphone can deploy in under just a few seconds. New users are enrolled immediately. There are no complicated or lengthy sign up processes, meaning people are more likely to use it
Wide Coverage. We cover anywhere in the world with Edge, 3G, 4G, or Wifi. We also offer limited no-data solutions as well. Anyone in the world can immediately use it, no matter where they are. 
Free. Our infrastructure is free to use. From New York City to Nairobi, anyone with internet access can use Zerobase to begin establishing the necessary check-in history for effective tracing.

What information is collected by Zerobase?
An individual’s identity is never known by the system.  Personally identifying information is therefore not stored and not subject to discovery by any other party. Zerobase has ensured it has sufficient security and privacy and abides by relevant local, state, and federal laws. 

How is Zerobase unique, can’t Google do this on a large scale with their location history?
Yes, Google can track the geo-coordinates of your movements specifically. But, that system has some operational drawbacks:
They do not necessarily have all data on who intersected with your location. While they might have huge coverage (Android phones, Google maps), there will be a few that intersect at your location which would slip through the trace coverage. Zerobase is unique in the sense that all users are immediately onboarded at participating locations.
Big data vs. Overwhelming data. It is most likely that your second-to-second geo-coordinates are not of interest to public health agencies. For example, if you walked out into the woods alone, from a public health perspective that is likely not relevant. The Zerobase data structure of location-based “check-ins” is much more manageable and “query-able” than full geo-location history.
Google may not have a direct line of communication to everyone who may have been exposed. Having the direct notification system that Zerobase has will be key. All users onboard can receive notifications through Zerobase.
There is too much data, too much computation and a few are likely to slip through the cracks, ruining the efficiency of virtual containment estimates.
The major drawback and differentiator between this system and Zerobase is most likely privacy. The issue of privacy becomes compounded when we start to involve HIPAA GDPR, etc. Similar measures were proposed in Germany to request geo coordinate historical data from telecommunications providers, however, there has been significant push back.
Ensuring privacy at the forefront is critical to establish trust and community buy-in. Google, Facebook, and other major companies might have used up that social capital as of late. Zerobase offers an alternative that is private and effective in the sense that public health agencies can effectively issue individualized instructions without necessarily knowing who is behind the ID, nor having to put in the tedious work to trace back the virus. Big data without “Big Brother.”

What technological resources does Zerobase require?
A computer and a printer is all that is required for businesses, public locations, and healthcare providers to activate Zerobase. Individual community members only need a cell phone.
